# Gas particle simulation
Simple gas particles simulation using arcade library.
This program tracks a floating particle and shows number of collisions with other particles, average collision-free distance and frequency of collisions per unit of time as an console output. Program allows to manipulate amount of particles, their initial speed and size. Particles are generated randomly on two dimentional plane with spawn collision avoidance.
